## Disclaimer
In the next version of Message Binary Encoder, the following mechanisms will be implemented:
- try catch  will be replaced by Global Exception Handler
- primitive logger (save to file) will be replaced the standard logger
  
The author skip implementing the above mechanism because it was not the goal of this task. The Author is aware that the code from Program.cs is only for demonstrational purposes because it only calls methods from IMessageCodec.
